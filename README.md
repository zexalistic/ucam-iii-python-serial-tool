This is for using uCam-iii(4D Systems) and take png picture by Python3

I wrote this by using https://github.com/YoheiKoga/uCam-II-Python as a reference.

I use a USB-TTL convert board to communicate with the camera.

I run my code on Ubuntu. I did some modification so that YoheiKoga's code could work correctly under Linux environment(His code was originally run on MacOS)
