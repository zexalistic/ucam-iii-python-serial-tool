This is for using uCam-iii(4D Systems) and take png pictures

Reference: 	https://github.com/YoheiKoga/uCam-II-Python. 
			uCam-iii datasheet

I use a USB-TTL convert board to grasp the data from the camera.

I run my code on Ubuntu. I did some modification so that YoheiKoga's code could work correctly under Linux environment(His code was originally run on MacOS).
